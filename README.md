## frissyn

A 15-year-old anime fanatic proficient in Python, Ruby, and Crystal. I also know JS/Node and C++, but I rarely use those in my projets. I mostly do web developement with Flask or make Python tools for various purposes (API wrappers, Utility modules, etc.) I'm currently on the lookout for a remote software engineering internship to improve my skills and get real world experience. Have you ever [forked a potato](https://github.com/drtshock/Potato)? 'Cuz I have :)
